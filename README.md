# Reverse Polish Notation Calculator

## Description

This repo contains a CLI implementation of a reverse polish notation calculator built using Typescript.
The main design consideration in the development of this tool to consistently provide the user with a clear picture of the state of their calculation. This manifests in three ways:

1. Beginning with a brief instructional prompt how to use the calculator, including its exit and clear commands
2. Providing users with the current stack after every input
3. Providing users with clear error messages and clean recoveries after invalid inputs
